The **Law of Demeter** (**LoD**) or **principle of least knowledge** is a design guideline for developing [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software)

- Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
- Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
- Only talk to your immediate friends.
